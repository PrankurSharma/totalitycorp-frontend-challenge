Thank you for visiting this project. This project was given as a part of selection process for the position of Frontend Developer.

Technical Skills Used: ReactJS, CSS

Link of deployed website: https://openseatotalityproject.netlify.app

The website is almost similar to the homepage of website: https://opensea.io/ taken from the list provided in the PDF of tasks.

Since the project required us to not use any 3rd party libraries, there is an abundant usage of flexbox in order to design the layout of the website.

Some areas of the original website followed a common structure. So, ReactJS helped me use a single component multiple times.

I have made the div sliding buttons with the help of flex in ReactJS. The styling of the pages is done using CSS

The concept of inline-block display was also used in order to ensure that divs remain in line untill certain width.

Implementing navbar and the footer was also highly reliant on flexbox. Navbar is a little different from the original website when toggled for smaller screen devices but performs the same functionality.

Flexbox and Media Queries are very mobile-friendly. So, I have used them several times in order to tweak the sizes of the components and ensure a smooth interface on all types of devices.


I have ensured that all buttons and anchor tags have a unique property on clicking or hovering. Since the anchor tags should not be used without href attribute, it might throw some warnings but will definitely work.


Note:

1. Some of the animations that were given by the original website have not been implemented.

2. The data in the original website changes every time as the details are fetched from the server but in this project, since the server is not used, some data has been stored in arrays which are exported everywhere by the reactjs file.

3. Images have been stored in the folders in the src folder itself.
